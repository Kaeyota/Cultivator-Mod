## Introduction

This is a cultivator mod for minecraft. As you gain levels, you become more powerful.

## Design rational:

Everything is based on the experience bar.
The goal is to enhance vanilla gameplay and minimally interfer.
We want it to fit very naturally and therefore avoid a database if possible.

## Ideas:

- At higher levels, player gets a greater xp gain
- Potions with ingredient order mattering
- Magical ingredients based on flowers
- Monsters get more powerful based on distance from (0,0), but are also worth more xp
- Different trials as you level ex. lightning, wither, posion, fall damage etc.
  - You get rewards apropriate to the trial you past.
- You do more damage as you level up, more hit points
- Armor and weapons can be upgraded with xp
- Flying swords. Flight with flying swords and decreases durability. Also a long range attack option.
- Implement meditation for gathering xp. Maybe at a higher level. Some kind of AFK prevention.
  - Possible holding special books to cultivate/meditate.
  - Cultivation of glutton. Eat diamonds to gain xp.
- Rare cultivation books in dungeon loot. Has additional information on level up trials.
- Spirit stones. Possibly based on emeralds.
  - When emeralds are mined, have a posibility of creating a spirit stone.
  - Special spirit stone veins.
- Formations based on spirit stones.
- Talismans. A piece of paper with a special name.
- Pill refining, using furance, with special dyes, and conduit as the base
- Cultivation technique that uses xp. Possibly by holding the book with the technique.
  - Concern about what will happen if xp drops and retaking trials.
  - Perhaps track what level the player has reached so they don't retake trials.
  - Make echantments at higher levels cost less, or have greater effects.
    - Possibly make it cost 30 levels worth of xp.
- xp for reading books based on page turn speed. Flip through slowly.
- Talisman to prevent level up, which uses durability. Or a one time use.
- Tailsman can be nametag or paper
